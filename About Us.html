        <p>We are a new organisation trying to alter the mindset of society to start their journey into fitness early <br> Whether it be a big or small commitment for them, but atleast some form of commitment <br> Simply because having some form health and fitness aspect to your life will make activities of any sort much easier as life passes on by <br> Allowing people to have access to a huge range of movements, exercises and stretches with explanations as to what it affects, how to do the chosen movement, and when this movement is useful in day to day <br> This all started off with one persons lifestyle changing after having a huge shock to their system and needing to make dramatic changes to be able to continue the life they had before but also enjoy new hobbies, activities and life in general without regrets</p>
